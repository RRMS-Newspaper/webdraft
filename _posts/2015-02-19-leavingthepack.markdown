We were out hunting when it happened. We were chasing down a group of squirrels who jumped into a pack of bushes. The bushes rustled. My dad got ready to pounce, and we were ready to back him up. But before he could jump, something jumped out at him.

It was another coyote. Bigger and stronger, it tackled my dad. They wrestled, and the big black coyote came out victor over my cloudy gray colored father.

"I am Will." The coyote announced himself with a growl as more coyotes jumped out of the bushes. These animals were bigger than us. They formed a big pack around their apparent leader, Will. "We challenge you to a fight. Whoever wins is the leader of a new pack. If you don't fight you will all be killed.â€

Murmurs shot through our pack, and my father stepped forward. "I am the leader, so I will fight. I will fight tomorrow in the meadow at sundown."

Will twisted his snout into a cruel grin. "You have yourself a deal."

Our packs parted and my mom and I surrounded my dad. "You are out of your mind," my mom chided him. "That other coyote is too big! You'll never win!"

My dad snapped at where my mom was trying to groom him. "What choice do I have?" He ran forward, back home.

We arrived just as the sun was sinking below the hills, where it dissolved into inky purple clouds. Will's pack came hooting over the grass, and my dad stepped forward. Will came to my dad, and without a word, my dad launched at Will. They become one gray-black, snarling, clawing ball. I turned around, unable to watch.

After a few minutes, my mom nudged me. I turn around to see my dad's body, torn and smeared with blood, and bent at an odd angle. Dead. I raced away, and only slowed when I felt my best friend Lydia following me.

"I can't stay. Not now. Not with them. I need to leave." The words spilled out of my mouth like an overflowing waterfall. I turned and ran, fast and strong, like it was all I'd ever known.

10 years later - Present Day

I awake from my deep sleep to a noise coming from outside my small den. My ears prick up, and I wish my mom were here to protect me. Don't get me wrong, I may look and be strong and fierce, but deep inside I still miss my mom and my best friend Lydia like crazy.

I leap up and creep outside. Something from inside a bush moves, and I don't give it time to jump. I pounce, and roll out fighting a sandy colored coyote. I snarl and claw at his face, and he snaps at me and breaks out. It's clear he was only hunting.
